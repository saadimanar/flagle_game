        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Flagle! Here's how you play:</p>
        <p>
           A flag of a country will be displayed.
           guess the flag in 3 guesses or less!
           each time you make a wrong guess it will give
           you a geographical hint that tells you how far away your guess was from the target country.
           if your guess is correct, you will be notified. Otherwise, try again!
        </p>
        <p>You can click "Show Another Flag" to display a new flag and play again! </p>
        <p> Have fun and test your knowledge of world flags!</p>
